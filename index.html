        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>
            I am a <strong>Computer Science & Engineering graduate</strong> and a dedicated
            <strong>Problem Solver</strong> with a strong track record on <strong>Codeforces and LeetCode</strong>.
            My expertise spans across <strong>Full-Stack Development (Flutter & Laravel)</strong> and
            <strong>Machine Learning</strong>, where I have developed <strong>15+ individual projects</strong>.
        </p>
        <p>
            I specialize in building intelligent systems, having engineered <strong>Hybrid ML models</strong>
            and curated <strong>custom datasets</strong> for complex research. My experience includes
            working with <strong>Google Earth Engine (GEE)</strong> and integrating <strong>REST APIs</strong>
            for environmental monitoring like the <strong>Air Quality Index project</strong>.
            From high-level AI implementation to system administration with <strong>Docker and Ubuntu</strong>,
            I bridge the gap between data science and production-ready software.

The system is built using an ESP8266 microcontroller and integrates multiple biomedical sensors including a pulse oximeter, temperature sensor, ECG sensor, and GPS module. It measures heart rate, blood oxygen saturation (SpO₂), body temperature, and ECG signals, while also providing live GPS location tracking.

All collected data is transmitted wirelessly over Wi-Fi to a cloud-based mobile application developed using the Blynk IoT platform. The mobile app allows caregivers, doctors, or family members to remotely monitor the user's health status and location in real time.

This project demonstrates practical knowledge of IoT systems, embedded programming, sensor integration, real-time data processing, wireless communication, and mobile app development."

Students can enroll in courses, watch video lessons, like and comment on content, and search for courses. Tutors can create and manage playlists, upload video content, and monitor engagement. Administrators have full control over users, courses, and platform data.

This project demonstrates practical knowledge of full-stack web development, role-based access control, database-driven applications, CRUD operations, and responsive UI design."
